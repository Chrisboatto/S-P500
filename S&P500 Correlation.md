**S&P500 Correlation**



Welcome to my project that attempts to solve an age old question: How can I find a way to get rich quick? This projects attempts to create a system to make a ton of money off of the stock market. Based off the data from the past five years of the S&P500 I have created a system in which your account will buy and sell negatively correlated stocks when the difference becomes too wide. 



Lets say both Stock A and Stock B are worth $100 and they are negatively correlated (so when Stock A goes up Stock B goes down.)  Lets also say that you own $1000 worth of Stock A and none of Stock B. The idea behind this program is that when the difference between the two stocks are 20% or more the program would sell Stock A and buy Stock B. Then when the stocks reverse course and Stock B becomes greater than Stock A by 20% the program would do the exact same thing and sell Stock B and buy Stock A. 



This program is great for any financial company to assist it's customers increase their wealth and make their lives a lot more financially stable. 



There are comments throughout the code to explain all of the steps within the document. If anyone would like to add on and improve the program I welcome it! If doing so please comment and tag my name on it. I would like to learn and see my program to the best of it's ability!
